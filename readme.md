# Window Wrangler
An application to list all open windows on windows.

to get started, `wndwrangle /?` should give you all the information you need.



### More Info:
you can use both / and - for command line arguments,
for example:
```
wndwrangle -h
wndwrangle /h
```
will both do the same thing (list hidden windows)
